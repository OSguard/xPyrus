=Installation of xPyrus under Linux=

This tutorial assumes you have a current linux installation available and you have basic experience with the Apache webserver, PHP, and PostgreSQL. You need the following additional software.


apache2
postgresql-8.1+
php5-pgsql
php5-gd
imagemagick


Configure the apache config of the used virtual host as follows:

Options FollowSymLinks
AllowOverride All
Download the latest version of Smarty to

htdocs/lib/lib-template
and extract the archive to lib-template/Smarty-x.x.xxx . Further copy in sql/ the file Makefile.local.template to Makefile.local and adjust the settings and scheme names. The same procedure applies to htdocs/conf/local_config.php.template. Apply the same database settings as in sql/Makefile.local are defined. Furthermore adjust:

LOG_DIR (e.g. $SVN/logs)
UPLOAD_DIR (e.g. $SVN/logs)
comment the line, that defines SHARED_MEMORY_OFFSET and set any 32-Bit-Int
set a PROJECT_NAME
possibly comment LOCAL_CACHE_DIR (otherwise htdocs/lib/lib-template/cache has to be writeable for the web server).
You can check the completeness of your local_config-configuration by opening /check-install.php in your browser.

Copy the file htdocs/conf/enabled_modules.php.template to htdocs/conf/enabled_modules.php.

To establish the database run in sql/ the following commands:

make create-db
createlang plpgsql unihelp
make create-accounts
make create-schema
make s1-t
Adjust the php config in your php.ini to

magic_quotes_gpc = Off
After all configure the DocumentRoot of the virtual host of your Apache webserver.

Optinally you can copy dummy data from testdata/uploads/* to uploads/ and testdata/htdocs/userfiles/* to htdocs/userfiles. Possibly you should adjust permissions (there is a perl script in htdocs/admin/check_permissions.pl to do so in a productive installation).

To enable URL rewrite do

cd htdocs/admin/
php5 generate_files.php
We recommand the XDebug-Extension of the PHP-PECL-Repository (pecl install xdebug, then adjust php.ini extension=xdebug.so)
